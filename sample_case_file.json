  "case": {
    "name": "The Riverside Robbery",
    "description": "A convenience store was robbed at gunpoint on March 15th. The defendant was arrested three days later based on witness identification. Security cameras were not working at the time of the robbery. The case involves eyewitness testimony, circumstantial evidence, and alibis.",
    "population": 75000
  },
  "prior": {
    "db": -48.75,
    "odds": "1 in 75,000",
    "reasoning": "Base rate probability that any random person in the city committed this specific robbery, assuming one perpetrator."
  },
  "evidence": [
    {
      "name": "Eyewitness Identification",
      "description": "The store clerk identified the defendant from a police lineup two days after the robbery. The clerk observed the robber for approximately 2-3 minutes during the incident. The lighting in the store was adequate, but the robber wore a baseball cap pulled low.",
      "prob_guilty": 0.65,
      "prob_innocent": 0.35,
      "explanation": "Eyewitness identification has known reliability issues. Studies show lineup identifications are correct about 65% of the time under good conditions, but stress, poor lighting, and weapon focus can reduce accuracy. The clerk had a reasonably good view but was under extreme stress."
    },
    {
      "name": "Fingerprints on Door Handle",
      "description": "Police found the defendant's fingerprints on the exterior door handle of the convenience store. The defendant claims he visited the store earlier that week to buy cigarettes. Store employees cannot confirm this visit, and the defendant cannot provide a receipt.",
      "prob_guilty": 0.7,
      "prob_innocent": 0.4,
      "explanation": "The fingerprints place the defendant at the scene, but the timing is unclear. The defendant's explanation is plausible - many people touch door handles when entering stores. However, the lack of corroboration for his claimed earlier visit slightly favors guilt."
    },
    {
      "name": "Similar Physical Build",
      "description": "The defendant matches the general physical description given by the witness: approximately 5'8\"-5'10\", medium build, wearing dark clothing. However, this description could fit thousands of people in the area.",
      "prob_guilty": 0.3,
      "prob_innocent": 0.7,
      "explanation": "Physical similarity is very weak evidence on its own. The description is generic and could apply to a large portion of the male population in the area. This type of evidence has minimal probative value."
    },
    {
      "name": "Proximity to Scene",
      "description": "The defendant lives approximately 6 blocks from the convenience store and walks past it regularly on his way to work. His normal route would take him directly past the store around the time of day when the robbery occurred.",
      "prob_guilty": 0.4,
      "prob_innocent": 0.6,
      "explanation": "Living near a crime scene is weak evidence. Many innocent people live in the vicinity of crimes. However, it does establish opportunity and familiarity with the location. The fact that he regularly passes by slightly increases the probability compared to someone who never visits the area."
    },
    {
      "name": "Work Alibi Evidence",
      "description": "The defendant claims he was at work during the robbery (2:30 PM on a Tuesday). However, his supervisor says he left work early that day, around 1:45 PM, saying he felt sick. The robbery occurred at 2:30 PM, and the defendant's workplace is a 15-minute walk from the store. Co-workers confirm he seemed agitated when he left.",
      "prob_guilty": 0.75,
      "prob_innocent": 0.25,
      "explanation": "This is significant evidence. The defendant's claimed alibi is contradicted by multiple witnesses. His early departure from work, the timing, and his reported agitation create a concerning pattern. However, people do legitimately get sick and leave work early."
    },
    {
      "name": "Financial Motivation",
      "description": "Bank records show the defendant's checking account was overdrawn by $200 three days before the robbery, and he had received two overdraft notices. His rent was due the following week. The robbery netted approximately $180 in cash.",
      "prob_guilty": 0.6,
      "prob_innocent": 0.4,
      "explanation": "Financial stress provides a possible motive for robbery. The amount stolen roughly matches his immediate financial need. However, many people experience financial difficulties without committing crimes. This evidence shows opportunity and potential motive but is not conclusive."
    },
    {
      "name": "Character Witness Testimony",
      "description": "Three long-time friends and the defendant's employer testified that he is honest, hardworking, and non-violent. He has no prior criminal record. His employer describes him as reliable and trustworthy, noting that he handles cash regularly at work without any issues.",
      "prob_guilty": 0.2,
      "prob_innocent": 0.8,
      "explanation": "Good character evidence and lack of criminal history favor innocence. People who regularly handle money honestly at work are statistically less likely to commit robbery. However, character evidence doesn't prove innocence - even people with good character can commit crimes under sufficient pressure."
