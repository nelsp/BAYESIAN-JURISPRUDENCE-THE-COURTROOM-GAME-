    "name": "The Stolen Intimate Photos Case",
    "description": "A collection of sexually explicit photos of Mrs. Reynolds has gone missing from a locked drawer in the master bedroom of the Reynolds estate. The cleaning lady, Maria Gonzalez, has been accused of stealing them. Only five people had regular access to the house and bedroom: the cleaning lady, Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds, the maintenance man, and Mr. Reynolds' brother.",
    "population": 5,
    "details": "The photos were stored in a locked drawer in the bedroom vanity. Mrs. Reynolds discovered they were missing after returning from a weekend trip. The drawer showed signs of being forced open with a thin tool. The cleaning lady, Maria, has worked for the family for 8 years with no prior incidents. The photos disappeared approximately two weeks after Mr. Reynolds' brother stayed at the house following a personal crisis."

      "prob_innocent": 0.60,
      "explanation": "If guilty, the cleaning lady would need opportunity to access the bedroom alone (95%). If innocent, her presence alone in the house multiple times is simply part of her normal cleaning duties (60%)."

      "prob_innocent": 0.25,
      "explanation": "If guilty, Maria would likely use a tool she had access to. If innocent, many people have access to similar common household tools, but her possession of one is notable."

      "prob_innocent": 0.15,
      "explanation": "If guilty, this could represent payment for selling the photos. If innocent, people occasionally receive cash gifts or have other income sources, though the timing is suspicious."

      "prob_innocent": 0.85,
      "explanation": "If Maria is guilty, it's unlikely the brother would be researching photo selling. If Maria is innocent, these searches strongly suggest someone else (likely the brother) was planning to sell the photos."

      "prob_innocent": 0.70,
      "explanation": "If Maria is guilty, it's unlikely the photos would be connected to someone else's online persona. If innocent, this evidence points to the maintenance man as a potential alternative suspect."
