    "name": "The Diamond Lounge Murder",
    "description": "High-end escort Sophia Vega was found strangled in a private VIP room at The Diamond Lounge, an exclusive gentleman's club. The club had 40 people present that night: 15 escorts, 20 clients, and 5 staff members. The defendant is a wealthy regular client who was seen arguing with the victim earlier that evening.",
    "population": 40,
    "details": "The victim was discovered by cleaning staff after hours. Security camera footage shows the victim entering the VIP room with the defendant at 11:30 PM, and the defendant leaving alone at 12:15 AM. The defendant claims he left the victim alive and well after their scheduled time together. The cause of death was manual strangulation, and time of death is estimated between 12:00-12:30 AM."

      "prob_guilty": 0.95,
      "prob_innocent": 0.35,
      "explanation": "If guilty, the defendant would necessarily be with the victim during the time of death (95%). If innocent, being the last known person to see the victim alive is circumstantial but concerning (35%)."

      "prob_guilty": 0.90,
      "prob_innocent": 0.20,
      "explanation": "If guilty, defensive wounds would likely transfer the attacker's DNA under the victim's nails. If innocent, some DNA transfer could occur during consensual intimate contact, but typically not under fingernails in significant amounts."

      "name": "Financial Dispute",
      "description": "Financial records and text messages reveal the victim was threatening to expose the defendant's embezzlement scheme unless paid $100,000 for silence.",
      "prob_guilty": 0.85,
      "prob_innocent": 0.10,
      "explanation": "If guilty, this provides a strong motive for murder. If innocent, while the blackmail threat existed, many people seek non-violent solutions to such problems."

      "name": "Bruising Pattern Analysis",
      "description": "Forensic analysis of bruising on the victim's neck indicates the attacker was left-handed. The defendant is left-handed.",
      "prob_guilty": 0.70,
      "prob_innocent": 0.25,
      "explanation": "Left-handedness occurs in approximately 10% of the population, but the bruising pattern is not 100% conclusive about handedness. If guilty, there's a high chance the bruising would match. If innocent, this is merely a demographic match shared with many others."

      "prob_guilty": 0.65,
      "prob_innocent": 0.30,
      "explanation": "Threatening statements often precede violence if the person is guilty. However, such statements are often hyperbolic expressions of anger that don't lead to violence if the person is innocent."
