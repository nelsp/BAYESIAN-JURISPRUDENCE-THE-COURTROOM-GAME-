    "name": "The Riverside Manor Murder",
    "description": "Famous novelist Eleanor Wright was found poisoned at her Riverside Manor during her annual literary gala. The victim was discovered in her study after excusing herself from 25 guests (5 family members, 10 close friends, and 10 literary associates). The defendant is her personal assistant who had access to her medication and was the last person seen with her.",
    "population": 25,
    "details": "The victim died from cyanide poisoning, which was added to her heart medication. The cause of death was initially thought to be natural until toxicology reports indicated homicide. The defendant is Eleanor's personal assistant of 7 years who claims she only delivered Eleanor's regular medication as instructed. The victim recently made significant changes to her will."

      "explanation": "If guilty, the defendant would almost certainly need access to the medication (95%). If innocent, there's a lower chance the defendant would be involved with the specific medication that was tampered with versus other staff or guests.",

      "prob_innocent": 0.05,
      "explanation": "A guilty person might research methods before committing the crime. An innocent person would rarely have reason to research such specific poisons, though the assistant might claim research was for one of the novelist's upcoming mystery books.",
