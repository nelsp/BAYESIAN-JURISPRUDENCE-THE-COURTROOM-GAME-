    "description": "High-end escort Sophia Vega was found strangled in a private VIP room at The Diamond Lounge, an exclusive gentleman's club. The club had 40 people present that night: 15 escorts, 20 clients, and 5 staff members. The defendant is a wealthy regular client who was seen arguing with the victim earlier that evening.",
    "population": 40,
    "details": "The victim was discovered by cleaning staff after hours. Security camera footage shows the victim entering the VIP room with the defendant at 11:30 PM, and the defendant leaving alone at 12:15 AM. The defendant claims he left the victim alive and well after their scheduled time together. The cause of death was manual strangulation, and time of death is estimated between 12:00-12:30 AM."

      "explanation": "Left-handedness occurs in approximately 10% of the population, but the bruising pattern is not 100% conclusive about handedness. If guilty, there's a high chance the bruising would match. If innocent, this is merely a demographic match shared with many others.",
