    "description": "At the Edge of Town Bar, a patron's throat was slashed late Saturday night. The bar had 50 people: 20 members of the 'Steel Vultures' biker gang and 30 regular patrons. A non-biker whose fingerprints were found on the murder weapon has been charged.",
    "population": 50,
    "details": "The victim was a regular patron with no known gang affiliations. The murder weapon was a hunting knife recovered from a trash bin behind the bar with 5 different sets of fingerprints on it. The defendant is a non-biker regular at the bar who claims he only handled the knife earlier in the evening to help cut limes for drinks."
